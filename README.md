# Gold-Price-Prediction
This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict gold prices based on historical data. The Random Forest Regression algorithm is implemented to handle this regression task and achieve accurate predictions.

Project Overview
The price of gold is influenced by various factors, such as market conditions, geopolitical events, and other economic indicators. This project aims to predict gold prices using a dataset containing historical data and features influencing the price.

Key Features
Data Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned and transformed to make it suitable for model training and evaluation.
Random Forest Regression: A robust ensemble learning method is used for predicting the continuous target variable (gold price).
Model Evaluation: Metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and visualization of predicted vs. actual values are used to evaluate model performance.

Visualization: A scatter plot showing actual vs. predicted values provides insight into the model's performance.
Tools and Libraries Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn (for Random Forest Regression and evaluation)
